const joggingAppDescription = '''
    Making a decision on whether to jog or not is something I needed to do one hour earlier.
    This app exactly helps me do that. I published it in playstore recently, but it is still
    not released to the public.
    Have a look at these APK files. First one is the recommended version. 
    If incompatible, try the second /& third choice.

const flutterTubeAppDescription = '''    
    This application uses the YouTube API to display and play the contents of 3 flutter-related 
    channels. I have rewritten the code with sound null safety.
    I would probably do it differently right now, but hey, it is up on the playstore and open source 
    too.
    (Project will not be receiving further updates from me!)

const openPortfolio = '''
    This project is special to me because it got me my first paying job in IT. Apart from being able
    to showcase projects, the user can also collect email subscriptions that can be later used to 
    communicate product releases.
